## About Smart City Standards​

Smart City standards, particularly NGSI-LD (Next Generation Service Interface - Linked Data), are essential frameworks for building interoperable and scalable smart city solutions. NGSI-LD is developed by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) and provides a standardized way to represent, access, and manage context information in smart city environments.

The standard is designed to serve as a common language for smart city applications, enabling different systems and services to communicate and share data seamlessly. It is a valuable resource for developers, city planners, and organizations, providing a convenient means to build interoperable smart city solutions that can integrate with existing infrastructure and future technologies.

NGSI-LD is a vital component of modern smart city ecosystems, serving as a reliable and accessible standard for context information management. It is a valuable tool for smart city development, enabling users to build applications that can work together, share data, and provide comprehensive urban intelligence.

You can learn more about NGSI-LD at [ETSI NGSI-LD Specification](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_cim009v010101p.pdf).

## About Urban Data Management​

Urban data management is a comprehensive approach to collecting, processing, storing, and analyzing data from various urban sources. It encompasses a wide array of data types including environmental data (air quality, weather), traffic data, infrastructure data, and citizen-generated data.

Effective urban data management is crucial for building intelligent city solutions that can make informed decisions, optimize resources, and improve quality of life for citizens. It requires robust data pipelines, real-time processing capabilities, and secure storage solutions.

UrbanReflex provides a complete platform for urban data management, offering tools and APIs to collect, process, and analyze urban data efficiently. It is a valuable resource for developers and city planners, providing a convenient means to build data-driven smart city applications.

## True Open Source​

UrbanReflex is a true open-source project. It is free to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of the MIT license. This legally binds the project to grow and be directed in the interest of all participants. The project team values openness and collaboration and is not driven by monetary interests.

This project is a collaborative effort to advance smart city development and make urban intelligence accessible to everyone. It is a valuable resource for developers, researchers, and organizations, providing a convenient means to build and deploy smart city solutions.
